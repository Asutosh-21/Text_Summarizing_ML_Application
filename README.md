# Text_Summarizing_ML_Application

Project Overview
This comprehensive guide takes you through building a text summarization application with machine learning models and a Streamlit frontend. The project is divided into five main parts:


Required Tools & Libraries

Development Environments:

Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development
VS Code for frontend development


Python Libraries:

Data processing: pandas, numpy
NLP: nltk, spaCy, transformers, gensim
ML: scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras, pytorch
Frontend: streamlit
Utilities: matplotlib, seaborn


Data Preparation & Exploration: Using Jupyter Notebooks to analyze summarization datasets
Model Development: Implementing both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques
Model Evaluation: Comparing different models using metrics like ROUGE and BLEU scores
Streamlit Frontend: Creating an interactive web interface using VS Code
Integration & Deployment: Bringing everything together and deploying the application

Core Models Implemented
The project implements three different summarization approaches:

TextRank (Extractive): Uses graph-based ranking to identify and extract important sentences
T5 (Abstractive): Leverages the T5 transformer model to generate new summaries
BART (Abstractive): Uses the BART transformer model specifically fine-tuned for summarization

Key Features of the Streamlit Application

Multiple summarization models with customizable parameters
Text input and file upload options
Summary metrics and visualizations
History tracking to compare different models
Responsive user interface with helpful instructions

Development Process
You'll start by exploring data in Jupyter Notebooks, then build and evaluate different ML models. Next, you'll create the Streamlit interface in VS Code, connecting everything into a functional application.
